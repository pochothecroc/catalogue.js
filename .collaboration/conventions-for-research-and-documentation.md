# Conventions for Researchers, Documenters, and Reviewers

As part of the Research and Documentation project, a member has to strictly follow these conventions to ensure that everyone involved in the library development can easily do their tasks.

## Research Conventions

Each researcher must make sure to adhere to the following conventions:

* **Reliable sources of data:** Websites generated by a keyword search including "good filesystem" and Wikipedia. If not enough data has been gathered, check the rest of the results returned by the Google search.

* **Research compilation:**
  * **Document location:** documentation/research
  * **Accepted document formats:**
    * Plain text (.txt)
    * Google Sheet (.gsheet)
    * Microsoft Excel spreadsheet (.xlsx)
    * CSV file (.csv)
