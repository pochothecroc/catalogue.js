# Catalogue.js

Catalogue.js is a JavaScript library for managing filesystems in a server and manipulating virtual filesystems from the client's side.

* **Quick retrieval:** Catalogue.js makes file and directory searching efficient by using categorization, tagging, and other types of metadata.

* **Advanced filters:** Easily look for the documents by applying multiple filters to the search.

* **Permission-based access:** Protect files and directories by verifying user access level.

* **Data encryption:** Encrypt data that comes in and out of the filesystem.

* **Access history:** Record any form of access to allow detailed review of the files and directories.

* **File version control:** Track file changes, prevent unnecessary overwrites, and restore previous versions of the file.

* **Real-time collaboration:** Support co-authoring, commenting, and annotation.

* **Seamless integration:** Share internal and external files seamlessly.

* **Automated recovery:** No need to worry about any file changes that were not completed as Catalogue.js should automatically create temporary files for back-up and restoration.

* **Simple file operations:** Basic file operations such as copying and moving made simple.

* **Efficient storage management:** Automatically detects any duplicate files and potential unused documents to allow developers to manage the storage smartly.
